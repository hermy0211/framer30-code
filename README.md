## Introduction

This repository stores the code for all of my [30 Days of Framer X](https://hermy0211.github.io/framer30/) projects, so you can start building a similar project on your own.

Not all of the functionality was built on code alone. Please refer to the instructions below and my [Medium](https://medium.com/@annelee_22736) posts for a brief overview to see how the code and design fits in together.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at hermy0211@naver.com.

## Issues and Contributing

#### Known Issues
Below is a list of known issues that I will tend to in the future.
- Project 02 : Full dragging functionality has not been built in yet.
- Project 05 : The perspective and rotate3d are updated asynchronously sometimes.
- Project 07 : Color change animation is glitchy.
- Project 10 : Only works for the topmost element.
- Project 17 : Only the 'Grocery' and 'Personal' categories have corresponding lists.
- Project 19 : Only works for the lowercase and space keys. There is also no text cursor.
